## Requirements

- go version > 1.24.1
- modern shell, (tested on zsh and bash)
- terminal emulator, with TRUE color support
Test TRUE color support by runnig
```shell
printf "\x1b[38;2;255;100;0mTRUECOLOR\x1b[0m\n"
```

If your terminal **emulator does NOT display the word** `TRUECOLOR` in **red**, it does not support 24-bit color, checkout [this gist](https://gist.github.com/weimeng23/60b51b30eb758bd7a2a648436da1e562).
