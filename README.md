## 🖥️ Terminal Requirements

Go Typer works best in terminals that support "TrueColor" (24-bit color). It's been tested extensively on Linux but runs great on macOS and Windows too!

Verify your terminal supports TrueColor by running:

```bash
printf "\x1b[38;2;255;0;0mTRUECOLOR\x1b[0m\n"
```

If you see "TRUECOLOR" in red, you're good to go! If not, check out [this compatibility guide](https://gist.github.com/weimeng23/60b51b30eb758bd7a2a648436da1e562).
