## Requirements

The app has been tested on linux,but should run on major platforms as long as they support "TrueColor".

You can check if your terminal emulator supports 24-bit color by running:

```bash
printf "\x1b[38;2;255;0;0mTRUECOLOR\x1b[0m\n"
```

If your terminal **emulator does NOT display the word** `TRUECOLOR` in **red**, it does not support 24-bit color, checkout [this gist](https://gist.github.com/weimeng23/60b51b30eb758bd7a2a648436da1e562).

Start the typing game:

```

```

### Options

- `-c, --cursor <type>`: Choose cursor type (block or underline)
- `-t, --theme <name>`: Choose a theme or path to custom theme file
- `--list-themes`: List all available themes

Examples:

```
# Start with underline cursor
go-typer start -c underline

# Use dark theme
go-typer start -t dark

# Use a custom theme file
go-typer start -t /path/to/custom/theme.yml

# List available themes
go-typer start --list-themes
```

## Themes

Go Typer supports customizable themes via YAML files in the `colorschemes` directory. 

Built-in themes:
- `default`: Standard light theme with green/blue colors
- `dark`: Dark theme with purple/blue accents
- `monochrome`: Minimalist black and white theme

### Creating Custom Themes

You can create your own themes by adding a new YAML file to the `colorschemes` directory or by specifying a custom path with the `-t` flag.

Theme files use the following structure:

```yaml
# UI Elements
help_text: "#626262"       # Help text at the bottom
timer: "#FFDB58"           # Timer display
border: "#7F9ABE"          # Border color for containers

# Text Display
text_dim: "#555555"        # Untyped text 
text_preview: "#7F9ABE"    # Preview text color
text_correct: "#00FF00"    # Correctly typed text
text_error: "#FF0000"      # Incorrectly typed characters
text_partial_error: "#FF8C00"  # Correct characters in error words

# Cursor
cursor_fg: "#FFFFFF"       # Cursor foreground color
cursor_bg: "#00AAFF"       # Cursor background color
cursor_underline: "#00AAFF" # Underline cursor color

# Miscellaneous
padding: "#888888"         # Padding elements color
```

## Usage and playing
```bash
