## üñ•Ô∏è Terminal Requirements

Go Typer works best in terminals that support "TrueColor" (24-bit color). It's been tested extensively on Linux but runs great on macOS and Windows too!
(if you see inconsistency with colors, animations or functionality with different terminal emulators please open an issue in this repo)

Verify your terminal supports TrueColor by running:

```bash
printf "\x1b[38;2;255;0;0mTRUECOLOR\x1b[0m\n"
```

If you see "TRUECOLOR" in red, you're good to go\! If not, check out [this compatibility guide](https://gist.github.com/weimeng23/60b51b30eb758bd7a2a648436da1e562).

> [\!CAUTION]
> Please avoid launching the game through `tmux` as it might cause unexpected behavior.

> [\!TIP]
> I recommend using terminal emulators like [`alacritty`](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) or [`kitty`](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty), as they are GPU accelerated and generally offer better performance.

## üöÄ Installation

Choose the installation method that suits you best:

<details>
<summary><b>‚¨áÔ∏è Download Binaries (Quickest Start)</b></summary>

Download the latest pre-built binaries for your operating system from the [Releases](https://github.com/prime-run/go-typer/releases) page. Here's a simplified way to download and install (rootless):

**Linux (x86_64):**

```bash
wget https://github.com/prime-run/go-typer/releases/download/v1.0.2/go-typer_1.0.2_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
tar -xzf go-typer_*.tar.gz -C ~/.local/bin go-typer
```

**macOS (Intel x86_64):**

```bash
wget https://github.com/prime-run/go-typer/releases/download/v1.0.2/go-typer_1.0.2_macOS_intel.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
tar -xzf go-typer_*.tar.gz -C ~/.local/bin go-typer
```

**macOS (Apple Silicon arm64):**

```bash
wget https://github.com/prime-run/go-typer/releases/download/v1.0.2/go-typer_1.0.2_macOS_apple-silicon.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
tar -xzf go-typer_*.tar.gz -C ~/.local/bin go-typer
```

After downloading and extracting, ensure that `~/.local/bin` is in your system's `PATH` environment variable. You can usually do this by adding the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then, reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # For Bash
# or
source ~/.zshrc  # For Zsh
```

Now you should be able to run Go Typer by simply typing `go-typer` in your terminal.

Built-in themes:
